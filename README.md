### What I learned

In this project I wanted to test my skills in grid without looking at resources online.

I have managed to create a similar layout as the design provided and have another layout in between those 2 layouts provided. I am happy with the results as I finished it without looking as resources.

### Continued development

I will continue to polish my skills in layouting using CSS Grids and Flexbox.
